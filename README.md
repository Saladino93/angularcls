# Angular Cls

Tools for calculating angular power spectra for cosmological surveys.


Can calculate in the Limber approximation, as well as a non-Limber approximation based on the FFTlog method, by https://github.com/xfangcosmo/FFTLog-and-beyond.

Some parts are quite fast. Others not. The goal is to tweak the code to have a simple and powerful one, especially for next-generation cosmological surveys.

You can choose whataver power spectrum you like, e.g. you can use https://github.com/alessiospuriomancini/cosmopower, as long as you maintain some format.

More updates to come.

## Examples

```Python
